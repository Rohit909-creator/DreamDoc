And no you do not actually die if you do not wake upbefore you die in your dream.\u00a0\u00a0In order to best understand your dream ofdying, it is important to look at what is going on in your waking life that mayhave triggered such a dream.Deathmeans new beginnings:Dreamingof your own death symbolizes inner changes, transformation,self-discovery and positive development that is happening within you or yourlife. You are undergoing a transitional phase and are becoming more enlightenedor spiritual.Big changes are aheadfor you where you are making a new start and leaving the past behind. If youare getting married or divorce, being promoted to a new position, moving to a new country,you may experience dreams of your own death.

As a child reaches certain\nmilestones and grows into an adult, dreaming of their death is symbolic of\ntheir own self-discovery, transition and transformation into a new stage of\nlife.Death\nmeans a part of you has died: Metaphorically,\ndying can be seen as an end or a termination to your old ways, bad habits,\ndestructive behavior or some\nother aspect of yourself. So dying does not always mean a physical death, but rather an ending of something.\u00a0In\nsuch dreams, the death is often represented by someone else. So if you dream\nthat someone is dead, then it means that you want to repress that aspect of yourself that\nis represented by the dying person. Whatever that person represents has no part in your own life\nanymore.\u00a0 Generally, dreaming\nabout someone's death implies that your feelings for that person are\ndead or that a significant change/loss is occurring in your relationship with\nthat person. If you see a stranger die in your dream,\nthen it implies that you are feeling detached from the changes that are\nhappening around you.\u00a0If you dream about the death of a child, then it\ninidicates that you need to let go of your immaturity and start being more\nserious. The death of a child can also mean that your inner child is being\nstifled.Death\nmeans a wake-up call:The\nfrightening and alarming nature of death can in itself be a wake- up call for\nsomething. It is your mind's way of trying to grab your attention to something\ndire in your waking life where you need to take action. Consider how you felt in\nyour dream and think about a situation in your waking life where you felt the\nsame way.For\nsome, dreaming of your own death may be a health warning.

Contraryto a popular myth, you will not actually die if you do not wake up before youhit the ground from the fall. ": " understand your falling dream, you need to look\nto what is going on in your waking life.Falling\nsuggests loss of control:When\nyou fall, you have no control and have nothing to hold on to. Thus your falling\ndream is analogous to a situation in your waking life where you are lacking or\nlosing control. You are feeling overwhelmed,\nperhaps in school, in your work environment, in your home life or maybe in your\npersonal relationship. You have lost your foothold and unable to keep\nup with the demands of your daily life.Falling\nsuggests insecurity:Falling\nin your dream means you are lacking any sense of security, stability and\nconfidence. You are\nnot sure where you stand in a particular circumstance or in your relationship.\nPerhaps you are at risk of losing your job or losing your home. Such loss can\nmake you feel that the ground is falling away underneath you. Moreover falling\ndreams also indicate feelings of shame, inferiority, vulnerability, and/or low\nself-esteem. You are afraid of not measuring up to others' expectations or to\nkeep up with the status quo. If you have recently have demands placed on you,\nthen it would not be surprising if you dreamt of falling.Falling\nsuggests reckless behavior:Your\nfalling dream may be a wake-up call of your reckless behavior or poor\ndecisions. You are headed the wrong way in life. And if you continue on the current path,\nyou are going to hit rock bottom. Falling in your dream could be viewed as an\nanalogy of your fall from grace.\u00a0\n\n\nFalling suggests sex:According to Freudian theory, dreams of falling\nindicates that you are on the verge of giving in to your sexual urges or\nimpulses. You are lacking\nindiscretion.Falling\nis a result of physiology:The\nphysiological changes within the body when you \"fall asleep\" may\nactually trigger a falling dream.

Lucid dreams occurwhen you realize that you are dreaming and then take control of the dream. Many dreamers describe the abilityto fly in their dreams as an exhilarating, joyful, and liberating experience.Flyingrepresents control:If you are flying with ease and are enjoying the scene and landscape below, thenit suggests that you are in charge and on top of a situation. You have risen above something. Flying dreams and the ability to control your flight is representative of yourown personal sense of power.Flyingrepresents a new perspective:Whenyou are flying, you have the ability to look down and get a wider perspective ofthings. As a result, your flying dream is telling you to look at the broaderpicture. From your higher vantage point, you can gain a new and different perspective on things.\u00a0Flyingrepresents freedom:Yourdream flight may be sending you a message that nothing is impossible; you can be anybody and do anything.Your ability to fly signifies hope, possibilities, reality and freedom ofexpression. It may also reflect your strong will and is a reminder for you notto give up. Nobody can tell you what you cannot do and accomplish.Such dreams can provide great motivation and renewed sense of freedom.Flyingrepresents spiritual connection:In some cases, your flying dream indicates that you have reached a higherspiritual connection. You are growing more in tune with your spirituality andyour dream of flight is a reflection of this.\u00a0Flyingrepresents escape:": "\ndream of flying can also function as an escape from the stresses and pressures\nof your everyday life. Instead of confronting your daily problems, you take\nflight and try to get away from it all.Flying\nrepresents inflated sense of self.When\nyou are flying, you may feel like you are a superhero. You feel invincible and\nundefeatable. Perhaps you think you are better than everyone else and have a\ntendency to look down on others. After all, when you are flying, you are\nactually looking down on them.\u00a0Conclusion:When\nanalyzing your flying dream, consider the significance of the the height,\ndirection and speed of your flight. Flying high and/or fast is analogous to your\nlevel of confidence. If you are flying low, then it indicates that you are\ncontent with the pace of your current life. Flying\nbackwards implies that you are reminiscing about your past.Usually\na flying dream is described as a positive and exhilarating experience, but if you are feeling fear\nwhile flying,\u00a0 then it suggests that you are afraid of new challenge and of success. Perhaps you\nare not ready to take the next step. Having difficulties staying in flight indicates a lack of power in controlling\nyour own circumstances. Things like power lines, trees, or mountains may be obstacles that you\nencounter in flight. These obstacles symbolize something or someone who is\nstanding in your way in your waking life. You need to identify what or who is\ntrying to prevent you from moving forward. Difficulty flying may also be an\nindication of a lack of confidence, lack of motivation or some hesitation on your part.\nPerhaps you\u00a0 have set unrealistic goals for yourself and now you are\nstruggling to meet those goals.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0other\ncommon dream themes:  chase\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 cheating\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 death\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 falling\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 flying\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 naked\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 snake\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 teeth\ndreams\u00a0 test\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n      Tweet\n\n\n\n\n\nFlying\n      Dreams Submitted By Our VisitorsExhilarated\n      FlyingI\n      Can Fly And I'm Not CrazyHard\n      Landing..other\n      dreams from the Dream Bank\u00a0This\nweb site designed and maintained by\u00a0Dream\nMoods, Inc.\nEmail the webmaster at dreammoods dot com with questions or comments about this\nweb site.\nView our\u00a0Disclaimer\u00a0and\u00a0Privacy\nPolicy.\nCopyright\u00a0\u00a02000-2017\u00a0Dream\nMoods, Inc.

Thetypical dream scenarios include having your teeth crumble in your hands, fallout one by one with just a light tap, grow crooked or start to rot. Such dreamsare not only horrifying and shocking, but they often leave you with a lastingimage throughout the day. So what does it mean?Fallingteeth relates to vanity:One theory is that dreams about your teeth reflect your anxieties about yourappearance and how others perceive you. Your teeth help to convey an image ofattractiveness and play an important role in the game of flirtation, whether itis flashing those pearly whites, kissing or necking. Thus, such dreams may stemfrom a fear of rejection, feeling unattractive, feeling sexually undesirable orfrom growing older.": " support this notion, a dream research found that women in menopause reported\na higher frequency of dreams about their teeth. So there seems to be a\ncorrelation with getting older and having more teeth dreams.Teeth are an\nimportant feature to your attractiveness and how you are presented to others.\nCaring about how you look is a natural concern.Falling\nteeth relates to communication:When\nyour teeth are missing, you may also have a harder time talking or annunciating\nyour words. Thus your falling teeth dream may be highlighting some communication\nissue. You are not speaking up about something or you feel prevented from doing\nso. Perhaps you are having\ndifficulties expressing yourself or getting your point across.Falling\nteeth relates to embarrassment:\nDreaming that your teeth are falling out or rotting may refer to your\nfears of being embarrassed or making a fool of yourself in some situation. Perhaps you\nfeel unprepared for the task at hand and are afraid of getting ridiculed. \nThese\ndreams are often an over-exaggeration of your worries and anxieties. In most\ncases, all your worrying is for nothing. Sometimes what you imagine is\nfar worse than what is the reality.Falling\nteeth relates to powerlessness:\nTeeth are used to bite, tear, chew and gnaw. In this regard, teeth symbolize\npower. And the loss of teeth in your dream may be from a sense of powerlessness.\nAre you lacking power in some current situation?\u00a0 You feel\nfrustrated when your voice is not being heard. You may be experiencing feelings\nof inferiority and a lack of self-confidence in some situation or relationship\nin your life. This dream may be an indication that you need to be more assertive\nand believe in the importance of what you have to say.\u00a0Falling\nteeth relates to health:In\ntraditional dream interpretation books, dreams of missing or losing teeth\npointed to malnutrition or poor diet. This notion may still be applicable to some\ndreamers.\u00a0The dream could also be a\nsign of poor dental health and that you need to visit a dentist.Falling\nteeth relates to death:We\ndon't usually believe that dreams are an omen or a prediction of some future\nevent. However, we have received numerous emails regarding dreams of\u00a0 loose, rotten, falling, or missing\nteeth and how it indicates that a\nfamily member or close friend is very sick or near death.

As with most common dream themes,dreams about taking a test have to do with anxiety. In such dreams, you may findthat you cannot answer any of the questions on the test, that the test is insome foreign language or that your pencil keeps breaking during the test.Perhaps time is running out and you cannot complete the exam in the allowedtime. Or perhaps, you arrive late and miss the exam altogether. These factors all result inyou failing the dream test.\u00a0Takinga test implies being unprepared:": "\ndream that you are taking a test suggests that you feel unprepared for some\nchallenge in your waking life. You may even be harboring some guilt because you did not\nprepare enough for a school exam, meeting, business proposal, or some project.\nPerhaps you have been procrastinating on a task and waited until the last minute\nto cram it all in.Taking\na test implies fear of failing:Sometimes\nyou may be overly anxious about a real life exam, interview, etc. You always\nthink of the worse case scenario. As a result, such anxiety could manifest into\na dream where you fail a test. Most of the time, though, people who have such dreams are unlikely to fail a\ntest in real life.Taking\na test implies lack of confidence:Failing\na test in your dream says a lot about your self-esteem and confidence or the lack of.\nYou tend to sell yourself short and overly worry about not making the grade or\nthat you are not measuring up to other people's\nexpectations of you.\u00a0 You may even be described as a people pleaser because\nyou don't want to let others down. You\nalways second-guess yourself and fear not being accepted or\nnot being good enough.\u00a0By\nfailing the dream test, you may be expressing a desire to hold yourself back.\nPerhaps you are not mentally ready to move forward to the next level.Taking\na test implies setting your goals too high:If\nyou set your goals too high, you may also experience a test taking dream. The\ndream may be telling you that you are setting yourself up for failure because\nyou have set unrealistic goals for yourself.\u00a0Taking\na test implies being scrutinized:Test\ndreams are also an indication that you are being judged. These dreams serve as a\nsignal for you to examine an aspect of yourself that you may have been\nneglecting and need to pay more attention to.\u00a0Conclusion:In\norder to better understand your test taking dream, identify what aspect of your\nwaking life is giving you a lot of anxiety or making you feel inadequate.\nIt\nis also important to keep in mind that dreams about taking a test are usually never\nabout the content of the test.
