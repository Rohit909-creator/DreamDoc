""I'm
Being Chased!""Being
chased in your dream is one of several common dream theme stemming from feelings of anxiety
in your waking life. In such dreams, you could be running from an attacker, an
animal, a monster or some unknown figure who wants to hurt or possibly kill you.
Fight or flight is an instinctive response to a physical
threat in the environment. Thus it is natural to run or hide or try to outwit
your pursuer. Being
chased signifies avoidance:To
dream that you are being chased is an indication that you are avoiding some
issues in your waking life. The actions in your dream exemplify how you respond
to
pressure and cope with fears, stress or various situations. Instead of confronting the situation,
you have a
tendency to run away and avoid issues that you are uncomfortable with
addressing.. Being
chased signifies close-mindedness :If
someone is chasing you in your dream, then it may also refer to your
close-mindedness. You are refusing to acknowledge a certain viewpoint or idea
and don't even want to give a listen to any opinion that is different from
yours.Being
chased signifies running away from yourself :Another
way to analyze your chase dream is how the pursuer or attacker may be an aspect
of your own Self. Perhaps you are suppressing or rejecting certain feelings or
certain characteristics of your Self. Anger, jealousy, fear, and even love can manifest
as a threatening figure in your dream. And you could  be projecting these
feelings onto the unknown chaser. Being
chased signifies fear :Running
from an attacker in your dream may simply
represent your fear of being attacked. Such
dreams are more common among women than men, who may feel physically vulnerable
in their surroundings. All you have to do is turn on the news to hear stories of
violence and sexual assault. You
are the one chasing:
If you are the one doing the chasing, then the dream may highlight your drive
and ambition to go after something you want, or go after someone you want. On
the other hand, it may also mean that you are falling behind in some aspect of
your life and are having to catch up to others. Conclusion:In
understanding your own dream of being chased, ask yourself who is chasing you so
that you can gain a better understanding .  What
are you running from? Turn around and confront your pursuer and ask them why
they are chasing you. 


Consider the distance or gap between you and your pursuer. This indicates your
closeness to the issue. If the pursuer is gaining on you, then it suggests that
the problem is not going to go away. The problem will surround you, until you
confront and address it. However, if you are able to widen the gap between your
pursuer, then you are able to successfully distance yourself from the problem.
In essence, the problem is fading away.

""My
Boyfriend Cheated On Me!""   Being
cheated on in a dream can often feel so real that you actually go and accuse
your spouse, boyfriend, girlfriend or significant other of it. Such dreams are
unsettling and disturbing. It often leaves you questioning your relationship.
Often dreams about infidelity are rarely about cheating, but rather more about
your own feelings of insecurity. So what is this dream exactly about?Being
cheated on points to neglect:A
lack of attention from your mate may trigger a dream where your mate is having
an affair. Since they are not paying attention to you, then you start to think that
their attention is focused on someone else. Perhaps your significant other is
working longer hours or traveling more or spending more time at the gym. All is
innocent, but your dreaming mind manifests time spent away from you as an
affair.Being
cheated on points to fear of abandonment:To
dream that your mate, spouse, or significant other is cheating on you also indicates
your fears of being abandoned. You are concerned about the future and whether
your significant other will be there for you. Perhaps you are waiting for a
commitment from your significant other. Often such dreams may occur because you
were abandoned before by an ex, by a parent or important person in your life.Being
cheated on points to low self-esteem:When
you feel unworthy, inadequate or that you do no measure up to the expectation of
others, you may dream that your lover is cheating on you. You have a low sense
of self-worth and feel that there is no reason for your mate to stay with
you. Consider who your significant other is cheating with in your dream. Is
this person someone who you think is better than you in some way? Are they
handsomer, prettier, thinner, richer, smarter, etc?Being
cheated on points to lack of trust:Trust
is an important element in a relationship. If that trust is compromised, then
you may express doubt in the relationship. One of these doubts can manifest
itself as a adulterous dream. Being
cheated on points to actual cheating:In
rare cases, your cheating dream may be about actual cheating in your relationship. You
may be overlooking cues or hints that your subconscious is picking
up to indicate that your significant other is not being completely truthful
or is not fully committed in the relationship.
Or perhaps you have been in denial about the infidelity. Being
the cheater in your dream:To
dream that you are the one having an affair suggests feelings of self-guilt and self-betrayal. You have compromised your
beliefs or integrity.
Sometimes the cheating may not be about your relationship, but rather a
situation where you cheated or where you were being dishonest.Alternatively,
your affair with someone else may be about some quality
in this person that you need to incorporate or acknowledge within your own self.
For example, if you are cheating on your mate with your boss, then the dream may
signify your desires for control, power and authority.Cheating dreams
may also reflect the intensity of your sexual passion; you are exploring
areas of your sexuality. In this scenario, the dream may actually serve as a
reaffirmation of your commitment to your relationship. If you are
approaching your own wedding date, then it is not uncommon to have dreams about
erotic experiences with partners other than your intended spouse. Such a dream
represents the newness of your sexual passion. It is important to note that such
a dream does not mean that you will stray or that your dream is telling you that
you are with the wrong person.Still
another dream interpretation of your infidelity suggests that your needs are not
being satisfied by your significant other. As a result, you start to look
elsewhere. You feel that there is something more out there.Conclusion:Even
though dreams about cheating are hardly about actual cheating, it is still
important to address the emotions that brought about the cheating dream.
Feelings of neglect, insecurity and mistrust are things that should be
confronted and discussed in
any personal relationship in order for the partnership to grow. It is time to
let your guard down and open a dialogue with your significant other..

life.
Dead
To
see or talk to the dead in your dream forewarns that you are being influenced by negative
people and are hanging around the wrong crowd. This dream may also be a way
for you to resolve your feelings with those who have passed on. Alternatively,
the dream symbolizes material loss.
If
you dream of a person who has died a long time ago, then it suggests that a
current situation or relationship in your life resembles the quality of that
deceased person. The dream may depict how you need to let this situation or
relationship die and end it. If you dream of someone who has
recently passed away, then it means that their death is still freshly in your
mind. Dreams can also be a way for you to keep loved ones who have past away
alive and still be in some aspect of your life. You are still trying to grasp the notion that he or she is really gone. If
the dead is trying to get you to go somewhere with him or her, then it signifies
that you are trying to understand their death. You also don't want to be alone.
To see and talk with your dead parents in your
dream is a way of keeping them alive. It is also a way of coping with the loss. You are using your dream as a last opportunity to say your final good-byes to them.
To
see your dead sibling, relative, or friend alive in your dream indicates that
you miss them and are trying to relive your old experiences you had with them.
In trying to keep up with the pace of your daily waking life, your dreams may
serve as your only outlet in coping and coming to terms with the loss of a loved
one.
To
dream of your dead child is a way for you to keep your child alive through your
dreams. For a parent to lose a child is extremely difficult. Such dreams occur
because you still cannot accept or understand how or why your child was taken
from you so soon.
Dreaming
of a dead person who passes away again in your dream means that you wished they
were still around to experience and share certain aspects of your life with you.
Such dreams are more likely to occur during happy times or during important
milestones in your life.
*Please

Dead
End
To
dream that have reached a dead end indicates that you have come to an abrupt end
in the pursuit of your goals. You must find another way to achieve your goals
because the current path is not working out. Alternatively, the dream may be
telling you that you are going nowhere. Perhaps, the dream is symbolic of a dead
end job or a dead end relationship. You need to reevaluate your options. 
Deadline 
To
dream of a deadline signifies your preoccupation with time. You feel that time
is running out for you and that will not be able to meet your goals by a set
time. You need to learn to prioritize and balance aspects of your life.
Deaf 
If
you are not deaf in real life and dream that you are deaf, then it suggests that
you are feeling secluded from the world. You may be closing yourself off from
new experiences or shutting yourself out.
Alternatively, the dream could indicate that your defenses are up.  There
is something that you are refusing to hear. Perhaps you have problems taking
criticism. The dream could just mean that you are in need of some peace and
quiet.
To
dream that someone else is deaf suggests that someone close to you is withdrawn.
Death 
To
dream about the death of a loved one suggests that you are lacking a certain
aspect or quality that the loved one embodies. Ask yourself what makes this
person special or what you like about them. It is that very quality that you are
lacking in your own relationship or circumstances. Alternatively, the dream
indicates that whatever that person represents has no part in your own life
anymore. In particular, to dream about the death of your living parents indicates
that you are undergoing a significant change in your waking life. Your
relationship with your parents has evolved into a new realm. If you dream
about the death of a child, then it implies that you need to let go of your
immaturity and start being more serious. As your child reaches certain
milestones and grows into an adult, dreaming of their death may be symbolic of
their own self-discovery, transition and transformation into a new stage of
life.
To
dream that you are faking your own death suggests that you are looking for a new
start. You need some change in your life. If you dream that your
significant other is faking their own death, then the dream represents something
new that you are learning about them. Or it may mean that they are not who you
thought they were. 
To
have a near death experience in your dream implies that you are experience a relapse
of sorts. You are reverting back to your old habits and ways. Alternatively, the
dream indicates that you are being given a second chance or second try at
something.
To
dream that you die in your dream symbolizes inner changes, transformation,
self-discovery and positive development that is happening within you or your
life. You are undergoing a transitional phase and are becoming more enlightened

there was some unfinished issue that is still left lingering long after their
death. You wished you had a little more time with them.On a
negative note, to dream that you die may represent involvement in deeply painful
relationships or unhealthy, destructive behaviors. You may feeling depressed or
feel strangled by a situation or person in your waking life. Perhaps your mind
is preoccupied with someone who is terminally ill or dying. Alternatively, you
may be trying to get out of some obligation, responsibility or other situation.

see someone dying in your dream signifies that your feelings for that person are
dead or that a significant change/loss is occurring in your relationship with
that person. Alternatively, you may want to repress that aspect of yourself that
is represented by the dying person. If you see a stranger die in your dream,
then it implies that you are feeling detached from the changes that are
happening around you. To
smell death in your dream refers to a situation that has long been dead. It is

""I
Died In My Dream Last Night""   Death
dreams can be quite jarring and scary as if it was a premonition of your own imminent
death or a death of a loved one.
However, there
is no need to be alarmed or panic. And no you do not actually die if you do not wake up
before you die in your dream.  In order to best understand your dream of
dying, it is important to look at what is going on in your waking life that may
have triggered such a dream.Death
means new beginnings:Dreaming
of your own death symbolizes inner changes, transformation,
self-discovery and positive development that is happening within you or your
life. You are undergoing a transitional phase and are becoming more enlightened
or spiritual.
Big changes are ahead
for you where you are making a new start and leaving the past behind. If you
are getting married or divorce, being promoted to a new position, moving to a new country,
you may experience dreams of your own death. If you dream of faking your death,
then it suggests that you are taking control of your life and making a fresh start. You want
change in your life. If
you dream that your ex has died is your subconscious's way of telling you that the
relationship is dead and that you are moving on. To dream about the death of your living parents
indicates that you are undergoing a significant change in your waking life. Your
relationship with your parents has evolved into a new realm. As a child reaches certain
milestones and grows into an adult, dreaming of their death is symbolic of
their own self-discovery, transition and transformation into a new stage of
life.Death
means a part of you has died: Metaphorically,
dying can be seen as an end or a termination to your old ways, bad habits,
destructive behavior or some
other aspect of yourself. So dying does not always mean a physical death, but rather an ending of something. In
such dreams, the death is often represented by someone else. So if you dream
that someone is dead, then it means that you want to repress that aspect of yourself that
is represented by the dying person. Whatever that person represents has no part in your own life
anymore.  Generally, dreaming
about someone's death implies that your feelings for that person are
dead or that a significant change/loss is occurring in your relationship with
that person. If you see a stranger die in your dream,
then it implies that you are feeling detached from the changes that are
happening around you. If you dream about the death of a child, then it
inidicates that you need to let go of your immaturity and start being more
serious. The death of a child can also mean that your inner child is being
stifled.Death
means a wake-up call:The
frightening and alarming nature of death can in itself be a wake- up call for
something. It is your mind's way of trying to grab your attention to something
dire in your waking life where you need to take action. Consider how you felt in
your dream and think about a situation in your waking life where you felt the
same way.For
some, dreaming of your own death may be a health warning. Perhaps you
have been putting off a doctor visit. Or perhaps you need to make some unhealthy
lifestyle
changes.Death
means escape:To dream that you die may
mean that you are desperately trying to escape from the demands of your daily life.
This may be some major stressor, obligation, responsibility or perhaps you want
out of a painful relationship.Death
means coping with death:Dreaming
of death may be your subconscious way of dealing with the idea of death and your
own mortality. It is natural to be anxious about death. When will it
happen?  How will it happen? Will it hurt? Sometimes it is hard to think
about death consciously because it is unpleasant or taboo or you just don't want
to think about it. As a result, you push it into your subconscious where it may
play out in your dream. If
someone in your life is terminally ill or dying, then it is not surprising for
death to be on your mind and in your dream more often.Death
means self-sacrifices:In
some cases, to dream that you die is symbolic of your sacrifices. You feel that
you are always putting your needs of others first.Death
means missing characteristic:Dreaming
about the death of a loved one suggests that you are lacking a certain
aspect or quality that the loved one embodies. Ask yourself what makes this
person special or what you like about them. It is that very quality that you are
lacking in your own relationships or circumstances. Death
means resentment:More
directly, a dream about someone's death may mean that you are harboring some
deep seated resentment toward this person. . Dreaming
of someone who is already dead:To
see or talk to the dead in your dream forewarns that you are being influenced by negative
people and are hanging around the wrong crowd. This dream may also be a way
for you to resolve your feelings with those who have passed on. Alternatively,
the dream symbolizes material loss.If
you dream of a person who has died a long time ago, then it suggests that a
current situation or relationship in your life resembles the quality of that
deceased person. The dream may depict how you need to let this situation or
relationship die and end it. If you dream of someone who has
recently passed away, then it means that their death is still freshly in your
mind. You are still trying to grasp the notion that he or she is really gone. If
the dead is trying to get you to go somewhere with him or her, then it signifies
that you are trying to understand their death. You also don't want to be alone.To see and talk with your dead parents in your dreams represent your fears of losing them or your way of coping with the loss. You are using your dream as a last opportunity to say your final good-byes to them.To
see your dead sibling, relative, or friend alive in your dream indicates that
you miss them and are trying to relive your old experiences you had with them.
In trying to keep up with the pace of your daily waking life, you dreams may
serve as your only outlet in coping and coming to terms with the loss of a loved
one.To
dream of your dead child is a way for you to keep your child alive through your
dreams. For a parent to lose a child is extremely difficult. Such dreams occur
because you still cannot accept or understand how or why your child was taken
from you so soon.It
is important to keep in mind that even though a person has passed away, it does
necessarily mean that your relationship with them is dead; the relationship is
just different now. Dreams can serve as a way for you to keep a connection and
maintain a relationship. Conclusion:Your
dream of death should usually not be taken literally. Look at the dream death as
symbolic of something in your waking life that is changing or ending. other

""I'm
Falling!""Another
very common dream is the dream where you are falling from a cliff, a building, a
rooftop, an airplane or from some higher ground. Contrary
to a popular myth, you will not actually die if you do not wake up before you
hit the ground from the fall. To understand your falling dream, you need to look
to what is going on in your waking life.Falling
suggests loss of control:When
you fall, you have no control and have nothing to hold on to. Thus your falling
dream is analogous to a situation in your waking life where you are lacking or
losing control. You are feeling overwhelmed,
perhaps in school, in your work environment, in your home life or maybe in your
personal relationship. You have lost your foothold and unable to keep
up with the demands of your daily life.Falling
suggests insecurity:Falling
in your dream means you are lacking any sense of security, stability and
confidence. You are
not sure where you stand in a particular circumstance or in your relationship.
Perhaps you are at risk of losing your job or losing your home. Such loss can
make you feel that the ground is falling away underneath you. Moreover falling
dreams also indicate feelings of shame, inferiority, vulnerability, and/or low
self-esteem. You are afraid of not measuring up to others' expectations or to
keep up with the status quo. If you have recently have demands placed on you,
then it would not be surprising if you dreamt of falling.Falling
suggests reckless behavior:Your
falling dream may be a wake-up call of your reckless behavior or poor
decisions. You are headed the wrong way in life. And if you continue on the current path,
you are going to hit rock bottom. Falling in your dream could be viewed as an
analogy of your fall from grace. 


Falling suggests sex:According to Freudian theory, dreams of falling
indicates that you are on the verge of giving in to your sexual urges or
impulses. You are lacking
indiscretion.Falling
is a result of physiology:The
physiological changes within the body when you ""fall asleep"" may
actually trigger a falling dream. When you dream of falling, you may feel your
whole body jerk or twitch. This sudden jolt is known as a myoclonic jerk and is
sometimes strong enough to wake you up.Conclusion:In
order to understand and interpret your falling dream, look
at what is happening in your waking life that could bring about the dream. Where
in your life do you feel a lost of control? What is causing your
insecurities?

""I'm
Flying!""Flying
dreams fall under a category of dreams known as lucid dreams. Lucid dreams occur
when you realize that you are dreaming and then take control of the dream. Many dreamers describe the ability
to fly in their dreams as an exhilarating, joyful, and liberating experience.Flying
represents control:If you are flying with ease and are enjoying the scene and landscape below, then
it suggests that you are in charge and on top of a situation. You have risen above something. Flying dreams and the ability to control your flight is representative of your
own personal sense of power.Flying
represents a new perspective:When
you are flying, you have the ability to look down and get a wider perspective of
things. As a result, your flying dream is telling you to look at the broader
picture. From your higher vantage point, you can gain a new and different perspective on things. Flying
represents freedom:Your
dream flight may be sending you a message that nothing is impossible; you can be anybody and do anything.
Your ability to fly signifies hope, possibilities, reality and freedom of
expression. It may also reflect your strong will and is a reminder for you not
to give up. Nobody can tell you what you cannot do and accomplish.
Such dreams can provide great motivation and renewed sense of freedom.Flying
represents spiritual connection:
In some cases, your flying dream indicates that you have reached a higher
spiritual connection. You are growing more in tune with your spirituality and
your dream of flight is a reflection of this. Flying
represents escape:To
dream of flying can also function as an escape from the stresses and pressures
of your everyday life. Instead of confronting your daily problems, you take
flight and try to get away from it all.Flying
represents inflated sense of self.When
you are flying, you may feel like you are a superhero. You feel invincible and
undefeatable. Perhaps you think you are better than everyone else and have a
tendency to look down on others. After all, when you are flying, you are
actually looking down on them. Conclusion:When
analyzing your flying dream, consider the significance of the the height,
direction and speed of your flight. Flying high and/or fast is analogous to your
level of confidence. If you are flying low, then it indicates that you are
content with the pace of your current life. Flying
backwards implies that you are reminiscing about your past.Usually
a flying dream is described as a positive and exhilarating experience, but if you are feeling fear
while flying,  then it suggests that you are afraid of new challenge and of success. Perhaps you
are not ready to take the next step. Having difficulties staying in flight indicates a lack of power in controlling
your own circumstances. Things like power lines, trees, or mountains may be obstacles that you
encounter in flight. These obstacles symbolize something or someone who is
standing in your way in your waking life. You need to identify what or who is
trying to prevent you from moving forward. Difficulty flying may also be an
indication of a lack of confidence, lack of motivation or some hesitation on your part.
Perhaps you  have set unrealistic goals for yourself and now you are
struggling to meet those goals.   other

""I'm
Naked!""So
you are going about your normal routine - going to school, waiting for the bus,
shopping at the store or
just walking down
the street - when you suddenly realize that you have forgotten to wear pants or
that you are, gasp, buck naked! Dreaming that
you are completely or partially naked may be alarming, but is very common. Nudity
symbolizes
a variety of things depending on your real life situation.Nudity
indicates vulnerability:When
you are without your clothes, you are also most vulnerable. There is absolutely
nothing that you can hide behind. Thus the dream may parallel a waking situation
where you feel helpless or where you have completely let your guard down.
Perhaps you are in a relationship where you have opened yourself up at the risk
of getting rejected.Nudity
indicates fear of exposure:
Becoming mortified at the realization that you are naked in a public place may
reflect
your fear of being exposed and feelings of shame. You may be hiding something and
are afraid that others can see right through you. Hence, you dream of yourself
naked!Metaphorically, clothes are a
means of concealment. And depending on the type of clothes you wear, you can hide
your identity or be someone else. But without your clothes, everything is hanging out
for all to see. You are exposed and stripped of your defenses. Thus your naked
dream may be telling you that you are trying to be someone who you really are
not. You are afraid of being exposed as a fraud or phony. Such anxieties are
elevated especially in situations where you are trying to impress others.
Perhaps you are in a new work environment or
in a new relationship.
You may be apprehensive in revealing your true feelings in these situations and are afraid of being ridiculed or disgraced. Nudity
indicates insecurity:

Your naked dream may also point to insecurity issues. You feel that all eyes
are always on you - laughing at you, judging you or criticizing you. Being
naked magnifies the notion that everyone is pointing at you and laughing. Most
of the time, it's all on your head.Nudity
indicates feeling unprepared:

Nudity also symbolizes being
caught off guard, not measuring up or not being ready for some important task. Finding yourself naked at work or in a classroom suggests
that you feel unprepared for a project at work or school. You fear that some flaw will be brought to public
attention. Dreaming of being naked is also an indication that you have set
unrealistic goals where you have no way of meeting them. Nudity
indicates arrogance:

Some dreams where you find yourself naked may be pointing to your arrogance in
some waking situation. Perhaps you have a tendency to look down on people or
think that you are better than others. By stripping you down to your birthday
suit, the dream may serve to humble you.Nudity
indicates freedom of expression:

If you dream that you are proud of your nakedness and show
no
embarrassment or shame, then it symbolizes your unrestricted sense of freedom. You have
nothing to hide and are proud of who you are. You
are trying to get to the ""bare facts."" The
dream relates to your honesty, openness, and
carefree nature. Nudity
indicates attention:

In some cases, dreaming of being in the nude implies that you are looking for
attention. You want to get noticed, but are going about it the wrong way. You
are drawing the wrong attention to yourself.Conclusion:Often times, when you realize that you are naked in your dream, no one else
seems to notice. Everyone else in the dream is going about
their business without giving a second look at your nakedness. It just
reiterates that your concerns or anxieties are your own projections; no one will notice
except you. You may be magnifying the situation and making an issue out of nothing.   other

""I'm
Naked!""So
you are going about your normal routine - going to school, waiting for the bus,
shopping at the store or
just walking down
the street - when you suddenly realize that you have forgotten to wear pants or
that you are, gasp, buck naked! Dreaming that
you are completely or partially naked may be alarming, but is very common. Nudity
symbolizes
a variety of things depending on your real life situation.Nudity
indicates vulnerability:When
you are without your clothes, you are also most vulnerable. There is absolutely
nothing that you can hide behind. Thus the dream may parallel a waking situation
where you feel helpless or where you have completely let your guard down.
Perhaps you are in a relationship where you have opened yourself up at the risk
of getting rejected.Nudity
indicates fear of exposure:
Becoming mortified at the realization that you are naked in a public place may
reflect
your fear of being exposed and feelings of shame. You may be hiding something and
are afraid that others can see right through you. Hence, you dream of yourself
naked!Metaphorically, clothes are a
means of concealment. And depending on the type of clothes you wear, you can hide
your identity or be someone else. But without your clothes, everything is hanging out
for all to see. You are exposed and stripped of your defenses. Thus your naked
dream may be telling you that you are trying to be someone who you really are
not. You are afraid of being exposed as a fraud or phony. Such anxieties are
elevated especially in situations where you are trying to impress others.
Perhaps you are in a new work environment or
in a new relationship.
You may be apprehensive in revealing your true feelings in these situations and are afraid of being ridiculed or disgraced. Nudity
indicates insecurity:

Your naked dream may also point to insecurity issues. You feel that all eyes
are always on you - laughing at you, judging you or criticizing you. Being
naked magnifies the notion that everyone is pointing at you and laughing. Most
of the time, it's all on your head.Nudity
indicates feeling unprepared:

Nudity also symbolizes being
caught off guard, not measuring up or not being ready for some important task. Finding yourself naked at work or in a classroom suggests
that you feel unprepared for a project at work or school. You fear that some flaw will be brought to public
attention. Dreaming of being naked is also an indication that you have set
unrealistic goals where you have no way of meeting them. Nudity
indicates arrogance:

Some dreams where you find yourself naked may be pointing to your arrogance in
some waking situation. Perhaps you have a tendency to look down on people or
think that you are better than others. By stripping you down to your birthday
suit, the dream may serve to humble you.Nudity
indicates freedom of expression:

If you dream that you are proud of your nakedness and show
no
embarrassment or shame, then it symbolizes your unrestricted sense of freedom. You have
nothing to hide and are proud of who you are. You
are trying to get to the ""bare facts."" The
dream relates to your honesty, openness, and
carefree nature. Nudity
indicates attention:

In some cases, dreaming of being in the nude implies that you are looking for
attention. You want to get noticed, but are going about it the wrong way. You
are drawing the wrong attention to yourself.Conclusion:Often times, when you realize that you are naked in your dream, no one else
seems to notice. Everyone else in the dream is going about
their business without giving a second look at your nakedness. It just
reiterates that your concerns or anxieties are your own projections; no one will notice
except you. You may be magnifying the situation and making an issue out of nothing.   other

""My
Teeth Are Falling!""   Dreams
of falling or crumbling teeth are the most common dreams that Dream Moods receives. The
typical dream scenarios include having your teeth crumble in your hands, fall
out one by one with just a light tap, grow crooked or start to rot. Such dreams
are not only horrifying and shocking, but they often leave you with a lasting
image throughout the day. So what does it mean?Falling
teeth relates to vanity:
One theory is that dreams about your teeth reflect your anxieties about your
appearance and how others perceive you. Your teeth help to convey an image of
attractiveness and play an important role in the game of flirtation, whether it
is flashing those pearly whites, kissing or necking. Thus, such dreams may stem
from a fear of rejection, feeling unattractive, feeling sexually undesirable or
from growing older.
To support this notion, a dream research found that women in menopause reported
a higher frequency of dreams about their teeth. So there seems to be a
correlation with getting older and having more teeth dreams.Teeth are an
important feature to your attractiveness and how you are presented to others.
Caring about how you look is a natural concern.Falling
teeth relates to communication:When
your teeth are missing, you may also have a harder time talking or annunciating
your words. Thus your falling teeth dream may be highlighting some communication
issue. You are not speaking up about something or you feel prevented from doing
so. Perhaps you are having
difficulties expressing yourself or getting your point across.Falling
teeth relates to embarrassment:
Dreaming that your teeth are falling out or rotting may refer to your
fears of being embarrassed or making a fool of yourself in some situation. Perhaps you
feel unprepared for the task at hand and are afraid of getting ridiculed. 
These
dreams are often an over-exaggeration of your worries and anxieties. In most
cases, all your worrying is for nothing. Sometimes what you imagine is
far worse than what is the reality.Falling
teeth relates to powerlessness:
Teeth are used to bite, tear, chew and gnaw. In this regard, teeth symbolize
power. And the loss of teeth in your dream may be from a sense of powerlessness.
Are you lacking power in some current situation?  You feel
frustrated when your voice is not being heard. You may be experiencing feelings
of inferiority and a lack of self-confidence in some situation or relationship
in your life. This dream may be an indication that you need to be more assertive
and believe in the importance of what you have to say. Falling
teeth relates to health:In
traditional dream interpretation books, dreams of missing or losing teeth
pointed to malnutrition or poor diet. This notion may still be applicable to some
dreamers. The dream could also be a
sign of poor dental health and that you need to visit a dentist.Falling
teeth relates to death:We
don't usually believe that dreams are an omen or a prediction of some future
event. However, we have received numerous emails regarding dreams of  loose, rotten, falling, or missing
teeth and how it indicates that a
family member or close friend is very sick or near death. We are including it as
a possible meaning of your falling teeth dream and you can decide for yourself.Falling
teeth relates to money:To
dream that your teeth is falling out signifies that there will be money coming
to you. This notion is based on the old tooth fairy tale. If you lose a
tooth and leave it under the pillow, a tooth fairy would bring you money. Falling
teeth relates to deception:
According to the Chinese, there is a saying that your teeth will fall out if you
are telling lies. Thus the dream may
imply that you are being untruthful or deceitful about some matter.
Conclusion:When
deciphering your falling teeth dream, look at what is happening in your waking
life that could bring about the dream. Teeth dreams may occur when you are
in a new relationship, when you switch jobs, or during a transitional period in
your life.

""I
Failed The Test""Taking
an exam in your dream implies that you are being put to the test or being
scrutinized in some area of your waking life. As with most common dream themes,
dreams about taking a test have to do with anxiety. In such dreams, you may find
that you cannot answer any of the questions on the test, that the test is in
some foreign language or that your pencil keeps breaking during the test.
Perhaps time is running out and you cannot complete the exam in the allowed
time. Or perhaps, you arrive late and miss the exam altogether. These factors all result in
you failing the dream test. Taking
a test implies being unprepared:To
dream that you are taking a test suggests that you feel unprepared for some
challenge in your waking life. You may even be harboring some guilt because you did not
prepare enough for a school exam, meeting, business proposal, or some project.
Perhaps you have been procrastinating on a task and waited until the last minute
to cram it all in.Taking
a test implies fear of failing:Sometimes
you may be overly anxious about a real life exam, interview, etc. You always
think of the worse case scenario. As a result, such anxiety could manifest into
a dream where you fail a test. Most of the time, though, people who have such dreams are unlikely to fail a
test in real life.Taking
a test implies lack of confidence:Failing
a test in your dream says a lot about your self-esteem and confidence or the lack of.
You tend to sell yourself short and overly worry about not making the grade or
that you are not measuring up to other people's
expectations of you.  You may even be described as a people pleaser because
you don't want to let others down. You
always second-guess yourself and fear not being accepted or
not being good enough. By
failing the dream test, you may be expressing a desire to hold yourself back.
Perhaps you are not mentally ready to move forward to the next level.Taking
a test implies setting your goals too high:If
you set your goals too high, you may also experience a test taking dream. The
dream may be telling you that you are setting yourself up for failure because
you have set unrealistic goals for yourself. Taking
a test implies being scrutinized:Test
dreams are also an indication that you are being judged. These dreams serve as a
signal for you to examine an aspect of yourself that you may have been
neglecting and need to pay more attention to. Conclusion:In
order to better understand your test taking dream, identify what aspect of your
waking life is giving you a lot of anxiety or making you feel inadequate.
It
is also important to keep in mind that dreams about taking a test are usually never
about the content of the test. It is more about the process and about the
feelings you experience while taking the test.   other
