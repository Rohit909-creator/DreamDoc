In such dreams, you could be running from an attacker, an\nanimal, a monster or some unknown figure who wants to hurt or possibly kill you.\nFight or flight is an instinctive response to a physical\nthreat in the environment. Thus it is natural to run or hide or try to outwit\nyour pursuer.\u00a0Being\nchased signifies avoidance:To\ndream that you are being chased is an indication that you are avoiding some\nissues in your waking life. The actions in your dream exemplify how you respond\nto\npressure and cope with fears, stress or various situations.

You are refusing to acknowledge a certain viewpoint or idea\nand don't even want to give a listen to any opinion that is different from\nyours.Being\nchased signifies running away from yourself :Another\nway to analyze your chase dream is how the pursuer or attacker may be an aspect\nof your own Self. Perhaps you are suppressing or rejecting certain feelings or\ncertain characteristics of your Self. Anger, jealousy, fear, and even love can manifest\nas a threatening figure in your dream. And you could\u00a0 be projecting these\nfeelings onto the unknown chaser.\u00a0Being\nchased signifies fear :Running\nfrom an attacker in your dream may simply\nrepresent your fear of being attacked. Such\ndreams are more common among women than men, who may feel physically vulnerable\nin their surroundings. All you have to do is turn on the news to hear stories of\nviolence and sexual assault. You\nare the one chasing:\nIf you are the one doing the chasing, then the dream may highlight your drive\nand ambition to go after something you want, or go after someone you want. On\nthe other hand, it may also mean that you are falling behind in some aspect of\nyour life and are having to catch up to others.\u00a0Conclusion:In\nunderstanding your own dream of being chased, ask yourself who is chasing you so\nthat you can gain a better understanding .  What\nare you running from? Turn around and confront your pursuer and ask them why\nthey are chasing you.\u00a0\n\n\nConsider the distance or gap between you and your pursuer. This indicates your\ncloseness to the issue. If the pursuer is gaining on you, then it suggests that\nthe problem is not going to go away. The problem will surround you, until you\nconfront and address it. However, if you are able to widen the gap between your\npursuer, then you are able to successfully distance yourself from the problem.\nIn essence, the problem is fading away.\n  \n\n\u00a0\u00a0other\ncommon dream themes: chase\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 cheating\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 death\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 falling\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 flying\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 naked\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 snake\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 teeth\ndreams\u00a0 test\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n      Tweet\n\n\n\n\n\nChase\n      Dreams Submitted By Our VisitorsGodzilla\n      in KmartCan't\n      Reach BoyfriendChased\n      By A SpiderCrocodile\n      Chase\u00a0This\nweb site designed and maintained by\u00a0Dream\nMoods, Inc.\nEmail the webmaster at dreammoods dot com with questions or comments about this\nweb site.\nView our\u00a0Disclaimer\u00a0and\u00a0Privacy\nPolicy.\nCopyright\u00a0\u00a02000-2017\u00a0Dream\nMoods, Inc.

Such dreams are\nunsettling and disturbing. It often leaves you questioning your relationship.\nOften dreams about infidelity are rarely about cheating, but rather more about\nyour own feelings of insecurity. So what is this dream exactly about?Being\ncheated on points to neglect:A\nlack of attention from your mate may trigger a dream where your mate is having\nan affair. Since they are not paying attention to you, then you start to think that\ntheir attention is focused on someone else. Perhaps your significant other is\nworking longer hours or traveling more or spending more time at the gym. All is\ninnocent, but your dreaming mind manifests time spent away from you as an\naffair.Being\ncheated on points to fear of abandonment:To\ndream that your mate, spouse, or significant other is cheating on you also indicates\nyour fears of being abandoned. You are concerned about the future and whether\nyour significant other will be there for you. Perhaps you are waiting for a\ncommitment from your significant other. Often such dreams may occur because you\nwere abandoned before by an ex, by a parent or important person in your life.Being\ncheated on points to low self-esteem:When\nyou feel unworthy, inadequate or that you do no measure up to the expectation of\nothers, you may dream that your lover is cheating on you. You have a low sense\nof self-worth and feel that there is no reason for your mate to stay with\nyou.\u00a0Consider who your significant other is cheating with in your dream. Is\nthis person someone who you think is better than you in some way? Are they\nhandsomer, prettier, thinner, richer, smarter, etc?Being\ncheated on points to lack of trust:Trust\nis an important element in a relationship. If that trust is compromised, then\nyou may express doubt in the relationship. One of these doubts can manifest\nitself as a adulterous dream.\u00a0Being\ncheated on points to actual cheating:In\nrare cases, your cheating dream may be about actual cheating in your relationship. You\nmay be overlooking cues or hints that your subconscious is picking\nup to indicate that your significant other is not being completely truthful\nor is not fully committed in the relationship.\nOr perhaps you have been in denial about the infidelity.\u00a0Being\nthe cheater in your dream:To\ndream that you are the one having an affair suggests feelings of self-guilt and self-betrayal. You have compromised your\nbeliefs or integrity.\nSometimes the cheating may not be about your relationship, but rather a\nsituation where you cheated or where you were being dishonest.Alternatively,\nyour affair with someone else may be about some quality\nin this person that you need to incorporate or acknowledge within your own self.\nFor example, if you are cheating on your mate with your boss, then the dream may\nsignify your desires for control, power and authority.Cheating dreams\nmay also reflect the intensity of your sexual passion; you are exploring\nareas of your sexuality. In this scenario, the dream may actually serve as a\nreaffirmation of your commitment to your relationship.\u00a0If you are\napproaching your own wedding date, then it is not uncommon to have dreams about\nerotic experiences with partners other than your intended spouse. Such a dream\nrepresents the newness of your sexual passion. It is important to note that such\na dream does not mean that you will stray or that your dream is telling you that\nyou are with the wrong person.Still\nanother dream interpretation of your infidelity suggests that your needs are not\nbeing satisfied by your significant other.

And no you do not actually die if you do not wake up\nbefore you die in your dream.\u00a0\u00a0In order to best understand your dream of\ndying, it is important to look at what is going on in your waking life that may\nhave triggered such a dream.Death\nmeans new beginnings:Dreaming\nof your own death symbolizes inner changes, transformation,\nself-discovery and positive development that is happening within you or your\nlife. You are undergoing a transitional phase and are becoming more enlightened\nor spiritual.\nBig changes are ahead\nfor you where you are making a new start and leaving the past behind. If you\nare getting married or divorce, being promoted to a new position, moving to a new country,\nyou may experience dreams of your own death. If you dream of faking your death,\nthen it suggests that you are taking control of your life and making a fresh start. You want\nchange in your life.\u00a0If\nyou dream that your ex has died is your subconscious's way of telling you that the\nrelationship is dead and that you are moving on. To dream about the death of your living parents\nindicates that you are undergoing a significant change in your waking life. Your\nrelationship with your parents has evolved into a new realm. As a child reaches certain\nmilestones and grows into an adult, dreaming of their death is symbolic of\ntheir own self-discovery, transition and transformation into a new stage of\nlife.Death\nmeans a part of you has died: Metaphorically,\ndying can be seen as an end or a termination to your old ways, bad habits,\ndestructive behavior or some\nother aspect of yourself. So dying does not always mean a physical death, but rather an ending of something.\u00a0In\nsuch dreams, the death is often represented by someone else. So if you dream\nthat someone is dead, then it means that you want to repress that aspect of yourself that\nis represented by the dying person. Whatever that person represents has no part in your own life\nanymore.\u00a0 Generally, dreaming\nabout someone's death implies that your feelings for that person are\ndead or that a significant change/loss is occurring in your relationship with\nthat person. If you see a stranger die in your dream,\nthen it implies that you are feeling detached from the changes that are\nhappening around you.\u00a0If you dream about the death of a child, then it\ninidicates that you need to let go of your immaturity and start being more\nserious. The death of a child can also mean that your inner child is being\nstifled.Death\nmeans a wake-up call:The\nfrightening and alarming nature of death can in itself be a wake- up call for\nsomething. It is your mind's way of trying to grab your attention to something\ndire in your waking life where you need to take action. Consider how you felt in\nyour dream and think about a situation in your waking life where you felt the\nsame way.For\nsome, dreaming of your own death may be a health warning. Perhaps you\nhave been putting off a doctor visit. Or perhaps you need to make some unhealthy\nlifestyle\nchanges.Death\nmeans escape:To dream that you die may\nmean that you are desperately trying to escape from the demands of your daily life.\nThis may be some major stressor, obligation, responsibility or perhaps you want\nout of a painful relationship.Death\nmeans coping with death:Dreaming\nof death may be your subconscious way of dealing with the idea of death and your\nown mortality. It is natural to be anxious about death. When will it\nhappen?\u00a0 How will it happen? Will it hurt? Sometimes it is hard to think\nabout death consciously because it is unpleasant or taboo or you just don't want\nto think about it. As a result, you push it into your subconscious where it may\nplay out in your dream.\u00a0If\nsomeone in your life is terminally ill or dying, then it is not surprising for\ndeath to be on your mind and in your dream more often.Death\nmeans self-sacrifices:In\nsome cases, to dream that you die is symbolic of your sacrifices. You feel that\nyou are always putting your needs of others first.Death\nmeans missing characteristic:Dreaming\nabout the death of a loved one suggests that you are lacking a certain\naspect or quality that the loved one embodies. Ask yourself what makes this\nperson special or what you like about them. It is that very quality that you are\nlacking in your own relationships or circumstances.\u00a0Death\nmeans resentment:More\ndirectly, a dream about someone's death may mean that you are harboring some\ndeep seated resentment toward this person. .\u00a0Dreaming\nof someone who is already dead:To\nsee or talk to the dead in your dream forewarns that you are being influenced by negative\npeople and are hanging around the wrong crowd.\u00a0This dream may also be a way\nfor you to resolve your feelings with those who have passed on. Alternatively,\nthe dream symbolizes material loss.If\nyou dream of a person who has died a long time ago, then it suggests that a\ncurrent situation or relationship in your life resembles the quality of that\ndeceased person. The dream may depict how you need to let this situation or\nrelationship die and end it.\u00a0If you dream of someone who has\nrecently passed away, then it means that their death is still freshly in your\nmind. You are still trying to grasp the notion that he or she is really gone. If\nthe dead is trying to get you to go somewhere with him or her, then it signifies\nthat you are trying to understand their death. You also don't want to be alone.To see and talk with your dead parents in your dreams represent your fears of losing them or your way of coping with the loss. You are using your dream as a last opportunity to say your final good-byes to them.To\nsee your dead sibling, relative, or friend alive in your dream indicates that\nyou miss them and are trying to relive your old experiences you had with them.\nIn trying to keep up with the pace of your daily waking life, you dreams may\nserve as your only outlet in coping and coming to terms with the loss of a loved\none.To\ndream of your dead child is a way for you to keep your child alive through your\ndreams. For a parent to lose a child is extremely difficult. Such dreams occur\nbecause you still cannot accept or understand how or why your child was taken\nfrom you so soon.It\nis important to keep in mind that even though a person has passed away, it does\nnecessarily mean that your relationship with them is dead; the relationship is\njust different now. Dreams can serve as a way for you to keep a connection and\nmaintain a relationship.\u00a0Conclusion:Your\ndream of death should usually not be taken literally. Look at the dream death as\nsymbolic of something in your waking life that is changing or ending.\u00a0other\ncommon dream themes: chase\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 cheating\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 death\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 falling\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 flying\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 naked\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 snake\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 teeth\ndreams\u00a0 test\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n      Tweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet\n        the Dream Moods app for your smartphone or tablet!\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet\n        the Dream Moods app for your smartphone or tablet!\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This\nweb site designed and maintained by\u00a0Dream\nMoods, Inc.\nEmail the webmaster at dreammoods dot com with questions or comments about this\nweb site.\nView our\u00a0Disclaimer\u00a0and\u00a0Privacy\nPolicy.\nCopyright\u00a0\u00a02000-2017\u00a0Dream\nMoods, Inc.

If you have recently have demands placed on you,\nthen it would not be surprising if you dreamt of falling.Falling\nsuggests reckless behavior:Your\nfalling dream may be a wake-up call of your reckless behavior or poor\ndecisions.

Falling in your dream could be viewed as an\nanalogy of your fall from grace.\u00a0\n\n\nFalling suggests sex:According to Freudian theory, dreams of falling\nindicates that you are on the verge of giving in to your sexual urges or\nimpulses. You are lacking\nindiscretion.Falling\nis a result of physiology:The\nphysiological changes within the body when you \"fall asleep\" may\nactually trigger a falling dream. When you dream of falling, you may feel your\nwhole body jerk or twitch. This sudden jolt is known as a myoclonic jerk and is\nsometimes strong enough to wake you up.Conclusion:In\norder to understand and interpret your falling dream, look\nat what is happening in your waking life that could bring about the dream.\u00a0Where\nin your life do you feel a lost of control?

Lucid dreams occur\nwhen you realize that you are dreaming and then take control of the dream. Many dreamers describe the ability\nto fly in their dreams as an exhilarating, joyful, and liberating experience.Flying\nrepresents control:If you are flying with ease and are enjoying the scene and landscape below, then\nit suggests that you are in charge and on top of a situation. You have risen above something. Flying dreams and the ability to control your flight is representative of your\nown personal sense of power.Flying\nrepresents a new perspective:When\nyou are flying, you have the ability to look down and get a wider perspective of\nthings. As a result, your flying dream is telling you to look at the broader\npicture. From your higher vantage point, you can gain a new and different perspective on things.\u00a0Flying\nrepresents freedom:Your\ndream flight may be sending you a message that nothing is impossible; you can be anybody and do anything.\nYour ability to fly signifies hope, possibilities, reality and freedom of\nexpression. It may also reflect your strong will and is a reminder for you not\nto give up. Nobody can tell you what you cannot do and accomplish.\nSuch dreams can provide great motivation and renewed sense of freedom.Flying\nrepresents spiritual connection:\nIn some cases, your flying dream indicates that you have reached a higher\nspiritual connection. You are growing more in tune with your spirituality and\nyour dream of flight is a reflection of this.\u00a0Flying\nrepresents escape:To\ndream of flying can also function as an escape from the stresses and pressures\nof your everyday life. Instead of confronting your daily problems, you take\nflight and try to get away from it all.Flying\nrepresents inflated sense of self.When\nyou are flying, you may feel like you are a superhero. You feel invincible and\nundefeatable. Perhaps you think you are better than everyone else and have a\ntendency to look down on others. After all, when you are flying, you are\nactually looking down on them.\u00a0Conclusion:When\nanalyzing your flying dream, consider the significance of the the height,\ndirection and speed of your flight. Flying high and/or fast is analogous to your\nlevel of confidence. If you are flying low, then it indicates that you are\ncontent with the pace of your current life. Flying\nbackwards implies that you are reminiscing about your past.Usually\na flying dream is described as a positive and exhilarating experience, but if you are feeling fear\nwhile flying,\u00a0 then it suggests that you are afraid of new challenge and of success. Perhaps you\nare not ready to take the next step. Having difficulties staying in flight indicates a lack of power in controlling\nyour own circumstances. Things like power lines, trees, or mountains may be obstacles that you\nencounter in flight. These obstacles symbolize something or someone who is\nstanding in your way in your waking life.

Dreaming that\nyou are completely or partially naked may be alarming, but is very common.\u00a0Nudity\nsymbolizes\na variety of things depending on your real life situation.Nudity\nindicates vulnerability:When\nyou are without your clothes, you are also most vulnerable. There is absolutely\nnothing that you can hide behind. Thus the dream may parallel a waking situation\nwhere you feel helpless or where you have completely let your guard down.\nPerhaps you are in a relationship where you have opened yourself up at the risk\nof getting rejected.Nudity\nindicates fear of exposure:\nBecoming mortified at the realization that you are naked in a public place may\nreflect\nyour fear of being exposed and feelings of shame. You may be hiding something and\nare afraid that others can see right through you. Hence, you dream of yourself\nnaked!Metaphorically, clothes are a\nmeans of concealment. And depending on the type of clothes you wear, you can hide\nyour identity or be someone else. But without your clothes, everything is hanging out\nfor all to see. You are exposed and stripped of your defenses. Thus your naked\ndream may be telling you that you are trying to be someone who you really are\nnot. You are afraid of being exposed as a fraud or phony. Such anxieties are\nelevated especially in situations where you are trying to impress others.\nPerhaps you are in a new work environment\u00a0or\nin a new relationship.\nYou may be apprehensive in revealing your true feelings in these situations and are afraid of being ridiculed or disgraced.\u00a0Nudity\nindicates insecurity:\n\nYour naked dream may also point to insecurity issues. You feel that all eyes\nare always on you - laughing at you, judging you or criticizing you.\u00a0Being\nnaked magnifies the notion that everyone is pointing at you and laughing. Most\nof the time, it's all on your head.Nudity\nindicates feeling unprepared:\n\nNudity\u00a0also symbolizes being\ncaught off guard, not measuring up or not being ready for some important task. Finding yourself naked at work or in a classroom suggests\nthat you feel unprepared for a project at work or school. You fear that some flaw will be brought to public\nattention. Dreaming of being naked is also an indication that you have set\nunrealistic goals where you have no way of meeting them.\u00a0Nudity\nindicates arrogance:\n\nSome dreams where you find yourself naked may be pointing to your arrogance in\nsome waking situation. Perhaps you have a tendency to look down on people or\nthink that you are better than others. By stripping you down to your birthday\nsuit, the dream may serve to humble you.Nudity\nindicates freedom of expression:\n\nIf you dream that you are proud of your nakedness and show\nno\nembarrassment or shame, then it symbolizes your unrestricted sense of freedom. You have\nnothing to hide and are proud of who you are.\u00a0You\nare trying to get to the \"bare facts.\" The\ndream\u00a0relates to your honesty, openness, and\ncarefree nature.\u00a0Nudity\nindicates attention:\n\nIn some cases, dreaming of being in the nude implies that you are looking for\nattention. You want to get noticed, but are going about it the wrong way. You\nare drawing the wrong attention to yourself.Conclusion:Often times, when you realize that you are naked in your dream, no one else\nseems to notice. Everyone else in the dream\u00a0is going about\ntheir business without giving a second look at your nakedness. It just\nreiterates that your concerns or anxieties are your own projections; no one will notice\nexcept you. You may be magnifying the situation and making an issue out of nothing.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0other\ncommon dream themes:  chase\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 cheating\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 death\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 falling\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 flying\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 naked\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 snake\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 teeth\ndreams\u00a0 test\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n      Tweet\n\n\n\n\n\nNaked\n        Dreams Submitted By Our VisitorsFlimsy\n        NightgownPE\n        In The BuffDoorless\n        Stalls..other\n        dreams from the Dream\n        Bank\u00a0This\nweb site designed and maintained by\u00a0Dream\nMoods, Inc.\nEmail the webmaster at dreammoods dot com with questions or comments about this\nweb site.\nView our\u00a0Disclaimer\u00a0and\u00a0Privacy\nPolicy.\nCopyright\u00a0\u00a02000-2017\u00a0Dream\nMoods, Inc.

Dreaming that\nyou are completely or partially naked may be alarming, but is very common.\u00a0Nudity\nsymbolizes\na variety of things depending on your real life situation.Nudity\nindicates vulnerability:When\nyou are without your clothes, you are also most vulnerable. There is absolutely\nnothing that you can hide behind. Thus the dream may parallel a waking situation\nwhere you feel helpless or where you have completely let your guard down.\nPerhaps you are in a relationship where you have opened yourself up at the risk\nof getting rejected.Nudity\nindicates fear of exposure:\nBecoming mortified at the realization that you are naked in a public place may\nreflect\nyour fear of being exposed and feelings of shame. You may be hiding something and\nare afraid that others can see right through you. Hence, you dream of yourself\nnaked!Metaphorically, clothes are a\nmeans of concealment. And depending on the type of clothes you wear, you can hide\nyour identity or be someone else. But without your clothes, everything is hanging out\nfor all to see. You are exposed and stripped of your defenses. Thus your naked\ndream may be telling you that you are trying to be someone who you really are\nnot. You are afraid of being exposed as a fraud or phony. Such anxieties are\nelevated especially in situations where you are trying to impress others.\nPerhaps you are in a new work environment\u00a0or\nin a new relationship.\nYou may be apprehensive in revealing your true feelings in these situations and are afraid of being ridiculed or disgraced.\u00a0Nudity\nindicates insecurity:\n\nYour naked dream may also point to insecurity issues. You feel that all eyes\nare always on you - laughing at you, judging you or criticizing you.\u00a0Being\nnaked magnifies the notion that everyone is pointing at you and laughing. Most\nof the time, it's all on your head.Nudity\nindicates feeling unprepared:\n\nNudity\u00a0also symbolizes being\ncaught off guard, not measuring up or not being ready for some important task. Finding yourself naked at work or in a classroom suggests\nthat you feel unprepared for a project at work or school. You fear that some flaw will be brought to public\nattention. Dreaming of being naked is also an indication that you have set\nunrealistic goals where you have no way of meeting them.\u00a0Nudity\nindicates arrogance:\n\nSome dreams where you find yourself naked may be pointing to your arrogance in\nsome waking situation. Perhaps you have a tendency to look down on people or\nthink that you are better than others. By stripping you down to your birthday\nsuit, the dream may serve to humble you.Nudity\nindicates freedom of expression:\n\nIf you dream that you are proud of your nakedness and show\nno\nembarrassment or shame, then it symbolizes your unrestricted sense of freedom. You have\nnothing to hide and are proud of who you are.\u00a0You\nare trying to get to the \"bare facts.\" The\ndream\u00a0relates to your honesty, openness, and\ncarefree nature.\u00a0Nudity\nindicates attention:\n\nIn some cases, dreaming of being in the nude implies that you are looking for\nattention. You want to get noticed, but are going about it the wrong way. You\nare drawing the wrong attention to yourself.Conclusion:Often times, when you realize that you are naked in your dream, no one else\nseems to notice. Everyone else in the dream\u00a0is going about\ntheir business without giving a second look at your nakedness. It just\nreiterates that your concerns or anxieties are your own projections; no one will notice\nexcept you. You may be magnifying the situation and making an issue out of nothing.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0other\ncommon dream themes:  chase\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 cheating\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 death\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 falling\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 flying\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 naked\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 snake\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0 teeth\ndreams\u00a0 test\ndreams\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n      Tweet\n\n\n\n\n\nNaked\n        Dreams Submitted By Our VisitorsFlimsy\n        NightgownPE\n        In The BuffDoorless\n        Stalls..other\n        dreams from the Dream\n        Bank\u00a0This\nweb site designed and maintained by\u00a0Dream\nMoods, Inc.\nEmail the webmaster at dreammoods dot com with questions or comments about this\nweb site.\nView our\u00a0Disclaimer\u00a0and\u00a0Privacy\nPolicy.\nCopyright\u00a0\u00a02000-2017\u00a0Dream\nMoods, Inc.

The\ntypical dream scenarios include having your teeth crumble in your hands, fall\nout one by one with just a light tap, grow crooked or start to rot. Such dreams\nare not only horrifying and shocking, but they often leave you with a lasting\nimage throughout the day. So what does it mean?Falling\nteeth relates to vanity:\nOne theory is that dreams about your teeth reflect your anxieties about your\nappearance and how others perceive you. Your teeth help to convey an image of\nattractiveness and play an important role in the game of flirtation, whether it\nis flashing those pearly whites, kissing or necking. Thus, such dreams may stem\nfrom a fear of rejection, feeling unattractive, feeling sexually undesirable or\nfrom growing older.\nTo support this notion, a dream research found that women in menopause reported\na higher frequency of dreams about their teeth. So there seems to be a\ncorrelation with getting older and having more teeth dreams.Teeth are an\nimportant feature to your attractiveness and how you are presented to others.\nCaring about how you look is a natural concern.Falling\nteeth relates to communication:When\nyour teeth are missing, you may also have a harder time talking or annunciating\nyour words. Thus your falling teeth dream may be highlighting some communication\nissue. You are not speaking up about something or you feel prevented from doing\nso.
